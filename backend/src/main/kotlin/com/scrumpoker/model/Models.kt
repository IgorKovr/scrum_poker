/**
 * Models.kt - Data Models for Scrum Poker Backend
 * 
 * This file contains all the data classes, enums, and model definitions used
 * throughout the Scrum Poker backend application. These models define the
 * structure of data as it flows through the system and is stored in memory.
 * 
 * Key Categories:
 * 1. Core Domain Models (User, Room)
 * 2. Request/Response Models for WebSocket communication
 * 3. State Transfer Objects for client updates
 * 4. Message enums and wrapper classes
 * 
 * The models are designed to be:
 * - Immutable where possible (using val)
 * - Mutable only where business logic requires it (using var)
 * - JSON-serializable for WebSocket communication
 * - Type-safe with clear property definitions
 * 
 * These models ensure consistency between the backend business logic
 * and the frontend client communication.

 * User Data Class - Represents a participant in a poker room

 * It contains all the information needed to track a user's participation
 * in a poker session, including their voting status and estimate.
 * 
 * The class uses a mix of immutable and mutable properties:
 * - Immutable: id, name, roomId (these don't change after creation)
 * - Mutable: estimate, hasVoted (these change during the estimation process)
 * 
 * @property id Unique identifier for the user (UUID)
 * @property name Display name chosen by the user
 * @property roomId Identifier of the room the user belongs to
 * @property estimate The user's story point estimate (null if not voted)
 * @property hasVoted Boolean flag indicating if user has submitted an estimate

 * 
 * The class transforms internal User objects into UserState objects that
 * contain only the information that should be visible to clients, respecting

 * 
 * This separation ensures that the backend can maintain full user state
 * while controlling what information is sent to clients based on the
 * current session state.

 * Message Types:
 * - JOIN: Client requests to join a room
 * - VOTE: Client submits an estimate
 * - SHOW_ESTIMATES: Request to reveal all estimates
 * - HIDE_ESTIMATES: Request to hide all estimates  
 * - DELETE_ESTIMATES: Request to clear all estimates and start fresh
 * - ROOM_UPDATE: Server sends updated room state to clients
 * - USER_LEFT: Notification that a user has left the room

 * The enum values match exactly with the frontend MessageType enum to ensure
 * consistent communication protocol between client and server.
