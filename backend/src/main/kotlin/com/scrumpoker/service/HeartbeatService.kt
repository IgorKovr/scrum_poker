/**
 * HeartbeatService.kt - Scheduled Service for Application Monitoring
 *
 * This service provides regular system health monitoring and logging capabilities. It runs on a
 * scheduled basis to provide insights into application performance, resource usage, and operational
 * status.
 *
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * 1. Memory usage monitoring and reporting
 * 2. System resource tracking (threads, memory, etc.)
 * 3. Application health status logging
 * 4. Regular maintenance and cleanup operations
 * 5. Performance metrics collection
 *
 * The service helps with operational monitoring and can alert administrators to potential issues
 * through log analysis. It's particularly useful for identifying memory leaks, performance
 * degradation, and system resource trends.
 *
 * Scheduling Configuration: The service uses Spring's @Scheduled annotation with fixed rate
 * execution, ensuring consistent monitoring intervals regardless of execution time.
