# ü©π Memory Leak Fixes

This document details the critical memory leak issues that were causing Railway memory limit problems and the comprehensive fixes implemented.

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **WebSocket Session Cleanup Failure**

**Problem**: The most critical issue was in `ScrumPokerWebSocketHandler.afterConnectionClosed()`. If `roomService.getUserById(userId)` returned null (which can happen due to race conditions or prior cleanup), the WebSocket session maps (`sessions` and `sessionToUser`) were never cleaned up.

**Impact**: Each disconnected user left behind orphaned WebSocket session entries, causing unbounded memory growth.

**Fix**: Always clean up WebSocket session maps regardless of user lookup success:

```kotlin
// CRITICAL FIX: Always clean up WebSocket session maps even if user lookup fails
sessions.remove(userId)
sessionToUser.remove(session.id)
```

### 2. **Unbounded Data Structure Growth**

**Problem**: The application had no limits on:

- Number of concurrent rooms (could grow infinitely)
- Number of users per room (could grow infinitely)
- Total number of users (could grow infinitely)
- WebSocket sessions (could grow infinitely)

**Impact**: Under load, these data structures could consume all available memory.

**Fix**: Implemented configurable limits with proper error handling:

```kotlin
private val MAX_ROOMS = 1000
private val MAX_USERS_PER_ROOM = 50
private val MAX_TOTAL_USERS = 5000
private val MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS = 10000
```

### 3. **Data Inconsistency Memory Leaks**

**Problem**: Users could be stored in `roomService.userSessions` but not in room.users (or vice versa), creating orphaned references that would never be cleaned up.

**Impact**: Gradual memory accumulation over time.

**Fix**: Added data consistency validation and automated cleanup in maintenance operations.

### 4. **No Proactive Memory Management**

**Problem**: The application only cleaned up on user disconnect, but had no mechanism to detect and clean up stale data, monitor memory usage, or perform preventive maintenance.

**Impact**: Gradual memory leaks would accumulate over time.

**Fix**: Implemented comprehensive memory management system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Comprehensive Fixes Implemented

### **1. Enhanced WebSocket Cleanup**

- **Fixed critical cleanup bug** that left session maps uncleaned
- **Added session limit enforcement** to prevent unbounded growth
- **Added session memory monitoring** with periodic logging
- **Graceful error handling** when limits are exceeded

```kotlin
// Always clean up session maps, even if user lookup fails
val userId = sessionToUser[session.id]
if (userId != null) {
    // ... try to clean up user from room ...

    // ALWAYS clean up WebSocket sessions
    sessions.remove(userId)
    sessionToUser.remove(session.id)
}
```

### **2. System Resource Limits**

- **Room limits**: Maximum 1000 concurrent rooms
- **User limits**: Maximum 50 users per room, 5000 total users
- **Session limits**: Maximum 10000 concurrent WebSocket sessions
- **Proper exception handling** when limits exceeded
- **Early warnings** when approaching limits (80% threshold)

### **3. Automated Maintenance & Cleanup**

- **Orphaned room cleanup**: Removes empty rooms automatically
- **Orphaned user cleanup**: Removes users not associated with any room
- **Data consistency validation**: Detects and reports inconsistencies
- **Event-driven maintenance**: Runs cleanup when users disconnect from WebSocket
- **Memory usage monitoring**: Regular logging of memory consumption

### **4. Enhanced Monitoring & Alerting**

- **Memory usage tracking**: Heap, free memory, utilization percentage
- **Application metrics**: Rooms, users, sessions, threads
- **Automated alerts**: High memory usage, excessive room/user counts
- **Structured logging**: Easy to parse for monitoring systems

### **5. Comprehensive Testing**

- **Memory leak prevention tests**: Verify cleanup works correctly
- **Limit enforcement tests**: Ensure bounds are respected
- **Consistency tests**: Validate data integrity
- **Maintenance tests**: Verify automated cleanup works

## üìä Memory Management Features

### **Proactive Monitoring**

```kotlin
// Memory usage logging every 5 minutes
üíæ MEMORY STATUS:
   Used: 156 MB / 512 MB (30.5%)
   Free: 356 MB
   Total Heap: 512 MB

üìä APPLICATION METRICS:
   Active Rooms: 23
   Total Users: 87
   Avg Users/Room: 3.8
   Active Threads: 12
```

### **Automated Alerts**

```kotlin
‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH MEMORY USAGE: 85.2% - Consider investigating memory leaks
‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH ROOM COUNT: 150 rooms - Potential memory leak detected
‚ö†Ô∏è Room count approaching limit: 850/1000
üö® WebSocket mapping inconsistency: 245 sessions vs 251 mappings
```

### **Maintenance Operations**

```kotlin
üßπ Maintenance cleanup completed: 3 rooms, 7 users removed
üßπ Cleaning up empty room 'abandoned-room-123'
üßπ Maintenance cleanup: removed orphaned user 'John' from room 'deleted-room'
```

## üéØ Results & Benefits

### **Memory Leak Prevention**

- **WebSocket sessions**: Always cleaned up, preventing primary leak source
- **Empty rooms**: Automatically removed, preventing room accumulation
- **Orphaned users**: Detected and cleaned up during maintenance
- **Data consistency**: Validated and maintained automatically

### **System Stability**

- **Bounded growth**: All data structures have configurable limits
- **Early warnings**: Alerts before reaching critical thresholds
- **Graceful degradation**: Proper error handling when limits exceeded
- **Resource protection**: Prevents memory exhaustion scenarios

### **Operational Visibility**

- **Memory monitoring**: Real-time insight into memory usage
- **Performance tracking**: Application metrics and trends
- **Issue detection**: Automated alerts for potential problems
- **Maintenance logging**: Complete audit trail of cleanup operations

### **Production Readiness**

- **Railway compatibility**: Designed for cloud memory constraints
- **Scalability**: Clear limits and monitoring for capacity planning
- **Maintainability**: Automated cleanup reduces operational overhead
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## üöÄ Implementation Guide

### **Configuration**

The memory management system is configured via constants in `RoomService.kt`:

```kotlin
private val MAX_ROOMS = 1000              // Adjust based on expected load
private val MAX_USERS_PER_ROOM = 50       // Balance between usability and memory
private val MAX_TOTAL_USERS = 5000        // Match your server memory capacity
```

### **Monitoring**

Monitor these log patterns for memory issues:

```bash
# High memory usage alerts
grep "HIGH MEMORY USAGE" scrum-poker.log

# Memory leak indicators
grep "approaching limit" scrum-poker.log

# Cleanup operations
grep "üßπ" scrum-poker.log

# Data inconsistencies
grep "üö®" scrum-poker.log
```

### **Maintenance**

The system is largely self-maintaining, but you can:

- **Adjust limits** based on server capacity and usage patterns
- **Monitor alerts** to detect issues early
- **Review cleanup logs** to understand usage patterns
- **Scale resources** when consistently hitting limits

## üî¨ Testing

Run memory leak prevention tests:

```bash
cd backend
./gradlew test --tests "*MemoryLeakPreventionTest*"
```

All tests verify:

- ‚úÖ Empty room cleanup works correctly
- ‚úÖ Orphaned user cleanup functions
- ‚úÖ System limits are enforced
- ‚úÖ Data consistency is maintained
- ‚úÖ Maintenance operations are idempotent

The fixes ensure your Scrum Poker application can run reliably on Railway and other memory-constrained environments without hitting memory limits.
