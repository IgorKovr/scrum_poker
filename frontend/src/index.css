/**
 * index.css - Global Styles and Tailwind CSS Configuration
 * 
 * This file serves as the main stylesheet for the Scrum Poker application.
 * It imports Tailwind CSS utilities which provide the entire styling framework
 * used throughout the application.
 * 
 * Tailwind CSS Layers:
 * 1. @tailwind base - Resets and base element styles
 * 2. @tailwind components - Reusable component classes (none defined currently)
 * 3. @tailwind utilities - All utility classes for styling
 * 
 * The application uses Tailwind's utility-first approach, meaning styles
 * are applied directly in JSX using predefined utility classes rather than
 * writing custom CSS. This provides:
 * - Consistent design system
 * - Responsive design utilities
 * - Small bundle sizes (only used utilities are included)
 * - No CSS naming conflicts
 * 
 * Color Scheme:
 * The app primarily uses gray and blue color palettes:
 * - Gray tones for backgrounds, borders, and text
 * - Blue tones for interactive elements and selected states
 * - Green for success states (voted indicators)
 * - Red for error states (connection issues)
 * 
 * Layout Approach:
 * - Uses Flexbox and CSS Grid utilities for layouts
 * - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
 * - Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
