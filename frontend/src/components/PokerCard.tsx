/**
 * PokerCard.tsx - Individual Poker Card Component
 * 
 * This component renders a single poker card that users can click to select
 * as their estimation. Each card displays a value (number or special symbol)
 * and provides visual feedback for selection state.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * 1. Interactive button with hover and focus states
 * 2. Visual selection feedback (color change, elevation)
 * 3. Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
 * 4. Accessible with proper focus management and keyboard support
 * 5. Smooth animations for state transitions
 * 
 * Visual States:
 * - Default: White background with gray border
 * - Hover: Slightly elevated with shadow increase
 * - Selected: Blue background with white text and elevation
 * - Focus: Blue ring for keyboard accessibility
 * 
 * The card uses Tailwind CSS for styling with conditional classes
 * based on the selection state.
